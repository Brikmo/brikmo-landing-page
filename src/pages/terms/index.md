      These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your use of the Brikmo services,
      including Brikmo’s website, Brikmo’s mobile applications, and any websites
      (or portions thereof) or mobile applications that are operated by Brikmo
      (collectively, the “Services”), and are entered into by you and Brikmo,
      Inc. (d/b/a Brikmo), a Delaware corporation (“Brikmo”).




      By using the Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms and acknowledge and agree to the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information in accordance with Brikmo’s Privacy Policy.




      SECTION 12 (“DISPUTES & ARBITRATION”) OF THESE TERMS PROVIDE THAT ANY CLAIMS THAT YOU AND BRIKMO HAVE AGAINST EACH OTHER, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY CLAIMS THAT AROSE OR WERE ASSERTED BEFORE THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THESE TERMS, WILL, WITH LIMITED EXCEPTIONS, BE SUBMITTED TO BINDING AND FINAL ARBITRATION. UNLESS YOU OPT OUT OF THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT YOU WILL ONLY BE PERMITTED TO PURSUE CLAIMS AND SEEK RELIEF AGAINST BRIKMO ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING. YOU ALSO WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO SEEK RELIEF IN A COURT OF LAW AND TO HAVE A JURY TRIAL ON YOUR CLAIMS. PLEASE SEE SECTION 12 FOR MORE INFORMATION REGARDING THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, THE POSSIBLE EFFECTS OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, AND HOW TO OPT OUT OF THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT.




      The Services comprise a platform that presents you with a community of Customers and Helpers that engage with each other in the marketplace for requesting, picking, purchasing, and delivery to a requested location. Picking, purchasing, and delivery services may be performed at local third party retailers (“Third Party Retailers”).




      Delivery may be conducted by each individual Helper’s select method of transportation. You (the Customer) acknowledge that transportation or logistics services are provided by third party independent contractors who are not employed by Brikmo.




      When you use the Services to place an order for products, you authorize the purchase and delivery of those products from the retailers you or your Helper selects. Unless otherwise specified, you acknowledge and agree that Brikmo and the Helper are acting as your agents in the picking, purchasing, packing, and delivery of goods purchased by you and are not the seller of the goods to you. You agree that your purchase is being made from the retailer you or your Helper has selected, that retailer is the merchant of record, and that title to any goods passes to you when they are purchased at the applicable retailer’s store. You agree that Brikmo or the applicable retailer will obtain a credit card authorization for your credit card on file with Brikmo to cover the cost of the goods you have purchased from the retailer and any separate Brikmo fees, and your card will be charged for the goods purchased by you and any applicable fees, taxes and/or tips. Your card may be temporarily authorized for an amount greater than the total amount of the purchase appearing in the original check out. This higher authorized amount will be disclosed during the purchase process and is a temporary authorization charge on your order, to deal with situations where your total purchase amount turns out to be higher than the original amount due to special requests, added items, replacement items or order adjustments.




      You also acknowledge and agree that, except as expressly provided for otherwise in these Terms or a separate agreement between you and Brikmo, Brikmo does not form any employment or agency relationship with you and does not hold title to any goods that you order through the Services.




      Unless otherwise indicated, all prices and other amounts are in the currency of the jurisdiction where the delivery takes place.




      Occasionally there may be information on the Services that contains typographical errors, inaccuracies, or omissions that may relate to pricing, product descriptions, promotions offers, and availability. Brikmo reserves the right to correct any errors, inaccuracies or omissions and to change or update information or refuse or cancel orders if any information on the Services is inaccurate at any time without prior notice (including after you have submitted your order and/or your credit card has been charged). Please note that prices of products are not provided on the Services and are not provided to Brikmo by the third-party retailer. It is your responsibility to confirm the prices of the products being requested prior to making your order.




      1. Your Use of the Services


      Brikmo grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, and revocable license to use the Services for their intended purposes subject to your compliance with these Terms and Brikmo’s policies. You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of the Services. Unless such restriction is prohibited by law or you have Brikmo’s written permission, you may not reverse engineer or attempt to extract the source code of the Services. You may only access the Services through the interfaces that Brikmo provides for that purpose (for example, you may not “scrape” the Services through automated means or “frame” any part of the Services), and you may not interfere or attempt to disrupt the Services.




      Some parts of the Services may allow you to upload or submit content (such as text, images, video, recipes, lists, links, and other materials). You retain all rights in any content that you upload or submit, and are solely responsible for that content. You grant Brikmo a non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide, transferable, sub-licenseable license to use, store, publicly display, publicly perform, reproduce, modify, create derivative works from, and distribute any such content for the purposes of operating, providing, and improving the Services. Brikmo may, in its sole discretion, remove or take down any content that you upload or submit to the Services for any reason, including violation of these Terms or any other policies.




      You may have the option of accessing the Services through downloadable software and this software may update itself automatically on your device. Some software, or portions of software, in the Services may be governed by open source licenses. In that case, Brikmo will make such licenses available to you and, in the case of conflict between such a license and these Terms, the open source license will control but only with respect to the software, or portion of the software, to which it applies.




      If you are using Brikmo on behalf of a business or other entity, you represent and warrant that you have the necessary authority to bind that business or entity to these Terms and that you are agreeing to these Terms on behalf of that business or entity.




      In order to use the Services, you may need to create a user account. You agree that you are responsible for all conduct and transactions that take place on or using your account and that you will take precautions to keep your password and other account information secure. You also agree that you will comply with all applicable laws when accessing or using the Services and you will respect those who you encounter in your use of the Services, including Helpers and individuals who support Brikmo’s Help Center. Brikmo reserves the right to decline orders, refuse partial or full delivery, terminate accounts, and/or cancel orders at any time in its sole discretion.




      We’re constantly modifying and improving the Services. Brikmo may introduce new features, change existing features, or remove features from the Services at any time and without notice. If you provide Brikmo with any feedback on or comments regarding the Services, you grant Brikmo the right to use such feedback or comments for any purpose without restriction or payment to you.




      If you have any requests for order cancellations, refunds, or returns, please visit your account to initiate such requests or review our Support articles for our policies regarding the same.




      2. Brikmo Communications


      By creating a Brikmo user account, you agree to accept and receive communications from Brikmo or Brikmo Helpers, including via email, text message, calls, and push notifications to the cellular telephone number you provided to Brikmo. You understand and agree that you may receive communications generated by automatic telephone dialing systems and/or which will deliver prerecorded messages sent by or on behalf of Brikmo, its affiliated companies and/or Helpers, including but not limited to communications concerning orders placed through your account on the Services. Message and data rates may apply. If you do not wish to receive promotional emails, text messages, or other communications, you may opt out of such communications at any time in Your Notification Settings. You may also opt-out of receiving text messages from Brikmo by replying “STOP” from the mobile device receiving the messages.




      If you use the Services to order a prescription drug product (where available), you understand and agree that the order conducted and information exchanged is strictly provided by you to the Brikmo Helper. You also understand and agree that confidential information may be disclosed by you relating to prescription drug products that you order through the Services. There is some level of risk that information in such communications could be read by an unintended third party. By using the Services to order a prescription drug product, you explicitly disclaim any liability against Brikmo for any harm or damage arising out of or in connection with any SMS messages, push notifications and/or other electronic notifications as forms of communication.




      3. Brikmo Promotions


      Brikmo Promotions offers its Customers/Helpers opportunities to earn more. These promotions are limited, and may change over time. Some promotions being offered now include:


      * Helpers: Refer a new user to Brikmo and fee deductions will be half-off the original 15% fee, providing the Helper more earning power. The 7% fee will remain active for 30 days from the day of your referred user’s first order, either as a Customer or Helper. 7% fee Activation will only be allowed to extend a total of 6 months maximum, and will be renewable at the end of the 6-month term.

      * Customers: Refer a new user to Brikmo and get the opportunity to win cash rewards once the Brikmo user community reaches certain milestones. Once the community user count reaches a specific count of users, Brikmo will randomly select a winner that has referred new users to the app. Every new referral is a new entry for the reward, giving the user more chances to win. Reward announcement and instructions will be provided to the winner via email. The milestones and associated rewards are found below:

      * * 100 users - $200
        * 1,000 users - $500
        * 10,000 users - $1,000
        * 100,000 users - $10,000
        * 1 million users - $100,000

      Brikmo Promotions are subject to change, and any future changes made to Brikmo Promotions do not affect the Terms of Service.




      4. Third-Party Retailer Memberships


      Certain third-party retailers may require memberships in order for Helpers to perform the Services. If you require a Helper to purchase items from a membership-based third-party retailer through the Services, you understand that you will need to note the requirement on your order, so that the Helper is aware before applying for the order. You also understand that you will need to contact the third-party retailer, and not Brikmo, if you have any questions regarding your membership or the management of your account.




      5. Transactions involving Alcohol


      You may have the option to order delivery of alcohol products in some locations and from certain retailers. You agree that you will comply with all applicable laws and not cause Brikmo, your Helper, or any third-party retailer to contravene any applicable laws. You agree that you are of legal drinking age for purchasing, possessing, and consuming alcohol (i.e., 21 years of age or older in the United States, 18 years of age or older in Alberta, Manitoba, and Quebec, and 19 years of age or older in all other Canadian provinces or territories). If you order alcohol products, you understand and acknowledge that neither Brikmo nor a Helper can accept your order of alcohol products if any party involved in the order is not of the legal age to purchase alcohol in their region. You agree that, upon delivery of alcohol products, the recipient will provide valid government-issued identification to Brikmo, proving their age to the Helper delivering the alcohol products, that the recipient will not be intoxicated when receiving delivery of such products, and that alcohol has not been purchased with the intent to resell the alcohol or provide the alcohol to someone who is not of legal drinking age. You agree that if any applicable legal requirements for the delivery of alcohol are not met, Brikmo reserves the right to cancel the order, and both parties (Customer and Helper) are at risk of losing their memberships on the Brikmo Platform. Special requests or substitutions for the purchase of alcohol products will not be honored; all requests for the purchase of alcohol products must be made through the Services at the time of submitting the order.




      Customers who purchase alcohol through the Brikmo Platform for delivery within the State of Hawaii acknowledge that IT IS ILLEGAL: (1) FOR A PERSON UNDER 21 YEARS OLD TO PURCHASE OR CONSUME LIQUOR, (2) TO USE FALSE IDENTIFICATION TO OBTAIN LIQUOR, (3) TO USE ANOTHER PERSON’S IDENTIFICATION TO OBTAIN LIQUOR, OR (4) TO PURCHASE LIQUOR FOR A PERSON UNDER 21 YEARS OLD. (Sections 281-78 & 101.5, Hawaii Revised Statutes).




      6. Delivery of Prescription Drug Products


      The formal delivery of prescription drug products is currently unavailable on the Brikmo Platform. It is also understood that the pickup and delivery of any legal products are authorized on Brikmo, which may include pharmacy-related products, and it is the sole responsibility of the Customer to determine if those products are applicable for delivery.

      7. Third-party Products and Content


      You agree that Brikmo does not assume responsibility for any products, content, services, websites, advertisements, offers, or information that is provided by third parties and made available through the Services. If you purchase, use, or access any such products, content, services, advertisements, offers, or information through the Services, you agree that you do so at your own risk and that Brikmo will have no liability based on such purchase, use, or access.




      9. SERVICE PROVIDED AS-IS AND RELEASE OF CLAIMS


      THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE." TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, BRIKMO DISCLAIMS ALL REPRESENTATIONS, CONDITIONS, AND WARRANTIES, EXPRESS, LEGAL, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, QUALITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, DURABILITY, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. IN ADDITION, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, BRIKMO MAKES NO REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY, CONDITIONS, OR GUARANTEE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY, TIMELINESS, QUALITY, SUITABILITY, OR AVAILABILITY OF THE SERVICES, ANY SERVICES PROVIDED BY HELPERS OR THIRD PARTY PROVIDERS, OR GOODS REQUESTED THROUGH THE USE OF THE SERVICES FROM RETAILERS, OR THAT THE SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE. BRIKMO DOES NOT GUARANTEE THE QUALITY, SUITABILITY, SAFETY OR ABILITY OF HELPERS, THIRD PARTY PROVIDERS, OR RETAILERS. YOU AGREE THAT THE ENTIRE RISK ARISING OUT OF YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES, ANY SERVICES PROVIDED BY HELPERS OR THIRD PARTY PROVIDERS, OR ANY PRODUCTS REQUESTED BY YOU OR DELIVERED TO YOU, REMAINS SOLELY WITH YOU.




      TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOU AGREE THAT NEITHER BRIKMO NOR ITS AFFILIATES, RETAIL PARTNERS, LICENSORS, OR SUPPLIERS IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE FITNESS OR CONDUCT OF ANY HELPER OR THIRD PARTY PROVIDER OR FOR ANY SERVICES PROVIDED BY ANY HELPER OR THIRD PARTY PROVIDER. NEITHER BRIKMO NOR ITS AFFILIATES, RETAIL PARTNERS, LICENSORS, OR SUPPLIERS WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, INJURY OR DAMAGE ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH THE ACTS OR OMISSIONS OF ANY HELPER OR THIRD PARTY PROVIDER.




      If you have a dispute with one or more Helpers or Third Party Providers, you agree to release Brikmo (including Brikmo’s affiliates, and each of their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, shareholders, retail partners, licensors, and suppliers) from any claims, demands and damages of every kind and nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected to such disputes.




      Furthermore, you expressly waive any rights you may have under California Civil Code Section 1542 (or analogous laws of other jurisdictions), which states: “A general release does not extend to claims that the creditor or releasing party does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release, and that, if known by him or her must, would have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor or released party.”




      10. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY


      THIS PROVISION APPLIES TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.




      IN NO EVENT SHALL BRIKMO (INCLUDING ITS AFFILIATES, AND EACH OF THEIR RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, SHAREHOLDERS, RETAIL PARTNERS, LICENSORS, AND SUPPLIERS) BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR INDIRECT DAMAGES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, DAMAGES FOR DELETION, CORRUPTION, LOSS OF DATA, LOSS OF PROGRAMS, FAILURE TO STORE ANY INFORMATION OR OTHER CONTENT MAINTAINED OR TRANSMITTED BY THE SERVICES, SERVICE INTERRUPTIONS, OR FOR THE COST OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE SERVICES) ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICES, OR THESE TERMS, HOWEVER ARISING INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE, EVEN IF BRIKMO OR BRIKMO’S AGENTS OR REPRESENTATIVES KNOW OR HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.




      IN NO EVENT SHALL BRIKMO (INCLUDING ITS AFFILIATES, AND EACH OF THEIR RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, SHAREHOLDERS, RETAIL PARTNERS, LICENSORS, AND SUPPLIERS) BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY AND/OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO PHYSICAL DAMAGES, BODILY INJURY, DEATH AND/OR EMOTIONAL DISTRESS AND DISCOMFORT) ARISING OUT OF YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES, ANY SERVICES PROVIDED BY HELPERS OR THIRD PARTY PROVIDERS, OR ANY PRODUCTS REQUESTED BY YOU OR DELIVERED TO YOU, EVEN IF BRIKMO OR BRIKMO’S AGENTS OR REPRESENTATIVES KNOW OR HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.




      BRIKMO, ITS AFFILIATES, RETAIL PARTNERS, LICENSORS, SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS RELATING TO THE SERVICES, ANY SERVICES PROVIDED BY HELPERS OR THIRD PARTY PROVIDERS, OR ANY PRODUCTS REQUESTED BY YOU OR DELIVERED TO YOU FOR MORE THAN THE GREATER OF $100 OR THE AMOUNTS PAID BY YOU TO BRIKMO FOR THE PAST 12 MONTHS OF THE SERVICES.




      11. Indemnification


      You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Brikmo and its officers, directors, employees, agents, shareholders, affiliates, and retail partners (each, an "Indemnified Party") from and against any losses, claims, actions, costs, damages, penalties, fines and expenses, including without limitation attorneys’ and experts’ fees and expenses, that may be incurred by an Indemnified Party arising out of, relating to or resulting from your unauthorized use of the Services or from any breach by you of these Terms, including without limitation any actual or alleged violation of any law, rule or regulation.




      12. Disputes & Arbitration


      If you have a dispute with Brikmo arising out of your use of the Services, this Section 12 applies. You agree to contact Brikmo first and attempt to work out any such dispute amicably.




      For residents of the United States, you agree to the following mandatory arbitration provisions:




      Mandatory Arbitration: If we’re unable to work out a solution amicably, both you and Brikmo agree to resolve any disputes arising out of your use of the Services or these Terms through binding arbitration or small claims court.




      CLASS ACTION WAIVER: TO THE EXTENT PERMISSIBLE BY LAW, ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES' INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, COLLECTIVE ACTION, OR NON-PAGA REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING (COLLECTIVELY “CLASS ACTION WAIVER”). THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S CLAIMS OR ENGAGE IN ANY CLASS ARBITRATION. YOU AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND BRIKMO ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.




      In any lawsuit in which (1) the complaint is filed as a class action, collective action or non-PAGA representative action; and (2) the civil court of competent jurisdiction in which the complaint was filed finds the Class Action Waiver is unenforceable (and such finding is confirmed by appellate review if review is sought), the Class Action Waiver shall be severable from this Agreement and in such instances, the class action, collective action and/or non-PAGA representative action must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not as a class, collective or non-PAGA representative arbitration.




      PAGA WAIVER: TO THE EXTENT PERMISSIBLE BY LAW, THERE WILL BE NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY DISPUTE TO BE BROUGHT, HEARD, OR ARBITRATED ON A GROUP BASIS OR IN ANY ACTION IN WHICH A PARTY SEEKS TO REPRESENT OTHER INDIVIDUAL(S) IN A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION (“PAGA WAIVER”). PAGA CLAIMS MAY ONLY BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS.




      In any lawsuit in which (1) the complaint is filed as a private attorney general action seeking to represent any individual(s) other than the named plaintiff; and (2) the civil court of competent jurisdiction in which the complaint was filed finds the PAGA Waiver is unenforceable (and such finding is confirmed by appellate review if review is sought), the PAGA Waiver shall be severable from this Agreement and in such instances, the private attorney general action must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not as a private attorney general arbitration.




      Notwithstanding any other clause contained in this Agreement, any claim that all or part of the Class Action Waiver or PAGA Waiver is invalid, unenforceable, unconscionable, void or voidable may be determined only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. The Class Action Waiver and PAGA Waiver shall be severable when a dispute is filed as an individual action and severance is necessary to ensure that the individual action proceeds in arbitration.




      Opt-out of Mandatory Arbitration: You can decline this mandatory arbitration provision within 30 days of accepting these Terms by emailing Brikmo at [team@brikmo.co](mailto:team@brikmo.co) with your first and last name and stating your intent to opt-out of the arbitration provision. Note that opting out of this arbitration provision does not affect any other part of these Terms, including the provisions regarding controlling law or in which courts any disputes must be brought.




      Arbitration Procedures and Location: The arbitration shall be administered by JAMS under its Comprehensive Rules in effect at the time the arbitration demand is made. The current rules, effective July 1, 2014, can be found here: http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/. JAMS arbitration rules can be found here: http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-clauses/. In the event of any conflict between the rules and this Agreement, this Agreement shall apply. The Parties agree to submit to the jurisdiction of a single neutral arbitrator selected in accordance with the JAMS Comprehensive Rules.




      The arbitration will be held in the United States county where you live or work, New York, New York, or any other location you and Brikmo mutually agree upon in writing.




      Arbitration Fees: The JAMS rules will govern payment of all arbitration fees and each party will be responsible for their own fees under those rules. However, Brikmo will pay for your reasonable arbitration fees where: (a) the claim for damages does not exceed $15,000, and (b) the claims are not frivolous under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b). Brikmo will not seek attorneys’ fees or costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b).




      13. Termination


      You can stop using the Services at any time and without notice to us. Similarly, Brikmo may terminate access to the Services to you or any other users or stop offering the all or part of the Services at any time without notice. In the event of Termination, Section 1 and Sections 4-16 survive and continue to apply to you.




      14. Controlling Law


      To the extent permitted by applicable law, these Terms will be governed by the laws of the State of California for residents of the United States and by the laws of the Province of Ontario for residents of Canada (except Quebec), without respect to its conflicts of laws principles. To the extent permitted by applicable law, any claims arising out of or relating to these Terms or use of the Services that are not subject to Section 12 (Disputes & Arbitration) of these Terms shall be brought exclusively in the federal or state courts of New York, New York, USA, for the residents of the United States, and the courts of competent jurisdiction in the City of Toronto for residents of Canada (except Quebec), and you and Brikmo consent to the personal jurisdiction of those courts.




      For Quebec residents only, to the extent permitted by law, these Terms will be governed by the laws of the Province of Quebec without respect to its conflicts of laws principles. To the extent permitted by applicable law, any claims arising out of or relating to these Terms or use of the Services that are not subject to Section 12 (Disputes & Arbitration) of these Terms shall be brought exclusively in the courts of competent jurisdiction in the City of Montreal, and you and Brikmo consent to the personal jurisdiction of those courts.




      15. Entire Agreement & Severability


      These Terms, subject to any amendments, modifications, or additional agreements you enter into with Brikmo, shall constitute the entire agreement between you and Brikmo with respect to the Services and any use of the Services. If any provision of these Terms is found to be invalid by a court competent jurisdiction, that provision only will be limited to the minimum extent necessary and the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect.




      16. No Waiver


      Brikmo’s failure to monitor or enforce a provision of these Terms does not constitute a waiver of its right to do so in the future with respect to that provision, any other provision, or these Terms as a whole.




      17. Assignment


      You may not assign any of your rights, licenses, or obligations under these Terms. Any such attempt at assignment by you shall be void. Brikmo may assign its rights, licenses, and obligations under these Terms without limitation.




      18. Changes to the Terms


      We may make changes to these Terms from time to time. When Brikmo does so, Brikmo will post the most current version of the Terms on Brikmo’s website and, if a revision to the Terms is material, Brikmo will notify you of the new Terms (for example, by email or a notification on the Services). Changes to these terms will not apply retroactively. If you do not agree to the modified terms, you should discontinue your use of the Services.




      19. Copyright and Trademark Policy


      Brikmo respects the intellectual property rights of others and has implemented a copyright and trademark policy in accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and other relevant laws. Brikmo will respond to valid notices of copyright infringement and reserves the right to terminate any users, at Brikmo’s sole discretion and without notice, who repeatedly infringe copyrights or other intellectual property rights.
