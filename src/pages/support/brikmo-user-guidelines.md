As a Brikmo user, you play a major role in ensuring that we cultivate and preserve an environment built on a foundation of Safety, Respect, and Integrity for everyone on the platform.

**Safety:** 

Safety is our first priority. Every individual should feel comfortable, safe, and secure using the Brikmo platform. We do not permit any activity that could create unsafe conditions or cause harm to others.

To ensure the highest levels of safety on the platform, we reserve the right to investigate and take action on any instances including, but not limited to, the following:

* Acts of violence or aggression including, but not limited to assault, violence/threats of violence, aggressive gestures, battery, abusive or threatening mental or verbal treatment, harassment, etc.
* Sexual conduct of any kind involving customers, contractors, or employees of retailers or Brikmo while receiving or facilitating services on the platform.
* Brandishing a weapon while receiving services unless state law expressly prohibits this restriction.
* Failure to verify your identity while receiving services on the platform.
* Demanding Helpers enter a residence. Brikmo Helpers are expected to deliver items to the Customer at their desired address, but are never expected or required to enter the residence of a customer and reserve the right to decline the request.

**Respect:** 

From the registers of the retail store to customers’ doors and everywhere in between, we strive to create and maintain a welcoming, inclusive, and respectful environment for everyone, at all times. Our expectation is simple: treat others the way you want to be treated.

As part of our continuous effort to promote respect on the platform, we reserve the right to investigate and take action on any instances including, but not limited to, the following:

* Discrimination of any kind on the basis of race, ethnicity, religion, gender or gender identity, age, marital status, sexual orientation, mental/physical condition or disability, age, profession, national origin or any other basis protected under applicable law.
* Vulgar, inappropriate, intrusive, harassing, abusive or unwanted language of any kind towards others, whether verbal or written. This includes, but is not limited to, asking overly personal questions of customers, contractors, retailer employees or Brikmo employees. Please note: Contact information between Helpers and Customers is anonymized when interacting through the Brikmo app. You do not need to share your personal phone number or email. The Brikmo app should not be used to communicate for issues other than order items, the status of an order, or the manner of delivery.
* Unwanted physical contact or sexual conduct of any kind involving contractors, retail employees, or Brikmo employees while receiving services is strictly prohibited and may potentially result in legal action.
* Intentional property damage or vandalism of any kind is prohibited and may result in legal prosecution.
* Creating disturbances for the surrounding public (e.g. neighbors, co-workers, store employees, security guards, etc) is strongly discouraged and may lead to permanent removal from the app and Brikmo services.

**Integrity:** 

Trust is a key ingredient in our recipe for success as a community. We expect all members of the Brikmo community to be honest and to represent and conduct themselves in a way that fosters trust across the platform.

As part of our continuous effort to promote integrity on the platform, we reserve the right to investigate and take action on any instances including, but not limited to, the following:

* Violation of any local, state, or federal laws while engaging with the Brikmo platform. Please note: All users on the Brikmo platform must be verified in order to use the app, and if any violation of laws are performed while using the app, the activities performed on the Brikmo platform may be provided to legal authorities and reviewed during the criminal investigation. See [Brikmo Privacy Policy](https://www.brikmo.co/privacy-policy) for more info.
* Engaging in spam or phishing-related activity.
* Abuse and/or manipulation of referral, coupon, or appeasement offerings, loyalty programs, etc.
* Encouraging others to participate in fraud or to disrupt the integrity of the platform.
* Misrepresentation of identity/contact information or providing false information to internal teams during delivery.
* Instances of theft.
* Sharing or distributing personal information of customers, shoppers, retailers or Brikmo employees. This includes taking screenshots of the Brikmo app while displaying personally identifiable or sensitive information.
* Unauthorized use of Brikmo’s trademark or intellectual property.
* Providing inaccurate or fraudulent information to Brikmo during the sign-up process or otherwise.
* Holding duplicate accounts.
