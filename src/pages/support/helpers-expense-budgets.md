**What are Expense Budgets?**

Expense Budgets are predetermined budgets allocated by Helpers specifically for purchasing Shopping Orders for Brikmo Customers. For the security of the Customers, these budgets are used by the Helpers to procure all items on the Customer’s Shopping Order list, and when the item is successfully delivered, the Expense Budget is instantly reimbursed into the user’s account. Expense Budget funds will be available for use after the completion of the Shopping Order, in order for the Helper to have maximum use of their Expense Budget throughout their entire Brikmo Helper work shift.

**What if Customer Cancels/Requests a Refund for the order after I used my Expense Budget?**

If a Customer happens to cancel an order after the items are paid for, most retailers will accept returns of all items, especially when recently purchased. So, returning the item(s) would be the very first step. Once the return is complete, your Expense Budget will likely be instantly deposited back into your original funding account for future use. For the protection of all our Helpers, once items have been purchased, and if the order is cancelled, the Helper will be compensated half their delivery fee for work performed. This way, our Helpers aren’t hung out to dry for their legitimate work.

**How do I determine my Expense Budget?**

Expense Budgets are generally based on the type of orders you as a Helper are capable of fulfilling. If you would like to provide larger orders, or orders which include more expensive items, then naturally, it would require a higher Expense Budget. A larger or more expensive order would likely constitute for a higher delivery fee, which is always up to the Helper. The marketplace and your area are guaranteed to tell you what level of returns you can expect as your Expense Budget or order type changes, but it is commonly expected that the more effort required in an order, the likelihood of a larger payment for those efforts. As a note: Brikmo does not determine delivery prices; we leave delivery prices up to those performing the deliveries. On that premise, the open market changes, and your Expense Budget may change. Brikmo allows our Helpers to make those changes at any point throughout the use of the app.

**Will Expense Budgets be the only way Helpers can fulfill Shopping Orders?**

We at Brikmo have a lot on the way regarding our community of users and how they interact with the Brikmo app. Specifically, we look to expand the ways our Helpers would fulfill orders, provide exceptional service, and grow their income potential.
