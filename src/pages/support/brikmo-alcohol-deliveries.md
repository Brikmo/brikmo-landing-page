Brikmo does not sell, offer to sell or solicit sales of alcohol: our Service enables you to search locally for alcohol and other products available for sale by licensed alcohol retailers, and request the delivery of the product by a Helper of legal age.

The Service is not meant to facilitate any improper furnishing of inducements by any manufacturer, importer, supplier, wholesaler or distributor of alcohol beverages to any retailer of alcoholic beverages or to facilitate any improper exclusionary practices by any alcohol beverage licensee. When you request an alcohol-product, the results will be based on your location and whether there are Helper’s that are eligible to deliver alcohol to you available. Our Service may be limited or not available at all in some places due to local law or other restrictions.

**Retailer/Helper right to refuse orders**

A Helper or a Retailer may refuse your order for any reason. If the product you want is not available, the Retailer will notify your Helper and offer a reasonable substitute or you can cancel your order. If you accept the substitution, the order total will be adjusted accordingly.

Sometimes the law requires Retailers to limit the number or type of product(s) in your order. If this happens, the Retailer will notify your Helper and offer a reasonable substitute or you can cancel the order. If you accept the substitution, the order total will be adjusted accordingly.

**Responsibility** 

Brikmo has preliminary ID verification technology that allows Helpers to verify their age, as well as the Customer’s age to confirm legal purchase of alcohol. In keeping Brikmo compliant with state alcohol regulators, Brikmo requires that Helpers verify the age of the Customer at delivery by reviewing the Customer’s ID before drop-off. Once confirmed, the item can be handed to the Customer. If the Customer is not available at the door at the time of delivery, the item must be returned, and the Customer will be charged an Alcohol Return Fee ($5.00).
