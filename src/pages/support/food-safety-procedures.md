**Practice Everyday Preventive Actions**

* Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth.
* Proper [hand hygiene](https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/hygiene/hand/handwashing.html) is an important infection control measure. Keep in mind where you can access and use facilities with soap and water during your shift. Wash your hands regularly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol.

**Key times to clean hands include:**

* Before, during, and after preparing food
* Before eating food
* After using the toilet
* After blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing
* Additional times to clean hands on the job include:
* * Before and after work shifts
  * Before and after work breaks
  * Before and after making a delivery
  * After putting on, touching, or removing cloth face coverings
  * After touching frequently touched surfaces such as doorbells or door handles
  * Before wearing and after removing cold-weather gloves
  * Before and after pumping gas
* Carry tissues in your vehicle and use them when you cough, sneeze or touch your face. Throw used tissues in the trash.

**Clean and Disinfect**

* Get and carry cleaning and disinfectant spray or disposable wipes and a trash bag with you in your vehicle.
* Clean and disinfect commonly touched surfaces at the beginning and end of each shift, particularly if the vehicle is also used by other drivers, following the directions on the cleaning product’s label. Clean surfaces that are visibly dirty with detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection. Frequently touched surfaces include the steering wheel, gearshift, signaling levers, door handles, and seatbelt buckles.
* Wipe down items such as pens and electronic signature pads/mobile devices if shared with a delivery recipient after each use.
* Appropriate disinfectants to use for hard non-porous surfaces include:
* * [EPA’s Registered Antimicrobial Products for Use Against Novel Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2](https://www.epa.gov/pesticide-registration/list-n-disinfectants-use-against-sars-cov-2)
  * Diluted household bleach solutions prepared according to the manufacturer’s label for disinfection, if appropriate for the surface
  * Alcohol solutions with at least 70% alcohol
* Establish designated pick-up zones for customers to help maintain social distancing.
* Practice social distancing when delivering food, e.g., offering “no touch” deliveries and sending text alerts or calling when deliveries have arrived.
* Conduct an evaluation of your facility to identify and apply operational changes in order to maintain social distancing if offering take-out/carry-out option by maintaining a 6-foot distance from others, when possible.
* Keep hot foods hot and cold foods cold by storing in appropriate transport vessels.
* Keep cold foods cold by keeping enough coolant materials, e.g., gel packs.
* Keep hot foods hot by ensuring insulated cases are properly functioning.
* Keep foods separated to avoid cross contamination, e.g., keeping raw foods separated from cooked and ready-to-eat foods.
* Ensure that any wrapping and packaging used for food transport is done so that contamination of the food is prevented.
* Routinely clean and sanitize coolers and insulated bags used to deliver foods.
