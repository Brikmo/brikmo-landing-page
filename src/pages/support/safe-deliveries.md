**Helpers: Stay home if you are sick**

* If you develop a fever or symptoms, such as cough or difficulty breathing, call your healthcare provider for medical advice before visiting their office.
* You should not return to working on the Brikmo platform until the [criteria to discontinue home isolation](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/disposition-in-home-patients.html) are met, after talking with your doctor.

**Wear a cloth face covering**

* [CDC recommends wearing cloth face coverings](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html) in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain, especially in areas where a lot of people are infected.
* Cloth face coverings may prevent people who donâ€™t know they have the virus from transmitting it to others.
* These face coverings are not surgical masks or respirators and are not appropriate substitutes for them in workplaces where masks or respirators are recommended or required.

**Limit contact**

* Avoid close contact with individuals as much as possible when picking up food, groceries, or other items at restaurants or grocery stores. This helps protect both you and the workers at the restaurants or grocery stores bringing the items to you.
* Practice contactless deliveries to the greatest extent possible. Contactless deliveries allow you to leave a delivery at a doorstep, move back to a distance greater than 6 feet away while verifying receipt of the delivery with the person getting the delivery, and try to do all interactions electronically (e.g., in an app or over a phone). This eliminates the need for close contact between you and the person getting the delivery.
* Limit your contact with frequently touched surfaces during pickups and deliveries, such as countertops, elevator buttons, doorbells, door handles, radio buttons, etc.
* Avoid sharing scanners, pens, or other tools with customers.
* Use a foot, shoulder, elbow, hip, or forearm instead of hands when opening doors at pick-up and delivery sites, if possible.
