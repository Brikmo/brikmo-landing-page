All Brikmo Helpers are generally paid on-demand via direct deposit to a checking or savings account. Once orders are completed successfully, funds are instantly presented in the Helper’s account dashboard. The Helper has the option to withdraw funds instantly, or wait the standard 5 business days for the funds to be automatically deposited into their bank account.

For instant deposits, or an immediate transfer of earned funds to a Helper’s bank account, an instant deposit fee of $3.00 per deposit will be applied in order to access their earnings more quickly. You can cash out at any time, as often as five times per day, as long as you have at least $20 in earnings. There’s a $2,000 daily limit.

Please note: Since Helpers are considered independent contractors, they may have to make estimated quarterly tax payments. That’s because Brikmo doesn’t withhold taxes from earnings like it does for full-time employees. See the [Tax Preparation](https://www.brikmo.co/helpers-tax-preparation) page for more info.
