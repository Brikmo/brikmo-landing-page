      1. Introduction




      This Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) describes how Brikmo, Inc. will gather, use, and maintain your Personal Information on the Brikmo Platform. It will also explain your legal rights with respect to that information. Your privacy is important to us. It is Brikmo, Inc.'s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect from you through our app, Brikmo.




      We only ask for personal information when we truly need it to provide a service to you. We collect it by fair and lawful means, with your knowledge and consent. We also let you know why we’re collecting it and how it will be used.




      By using the Brikmo Platform, you confirm that you have read and understand this Privacy Policy, and our Terms of Service (together referred to herein as the “Agreement”). The Agreement governs the use of the Brikmo Platform. Brikmo will collect, use, and maintain information consistent with the Agreement.




      2. Information you provide to Brikmo




      Brikmo collects certain personally identifiable information about you, including information that is reasonably capable of being associated with you (“Information”). Examples of Information that Brikmo collects include but are not limited to:




      Contact Information. This may include your first and last name, postal address, telephone number, and email address.




      Billing Data, including your payment instrument number (such as a credit or debit card number), expiration date, and security code as necessary to process your payments.




      Identity Information. We may collect Personal Information, such as your date of birth and address, national identification number if applicable, together with the result of basic criminal record checks as provided by you, or by our Third Party Agents, as applicable and to the extent permitted by law in your jurisdiction, and to validate your identity.




      Financial Information. To help all Users set up a payment account and to help make payments to Helpers and pay fees to Brikmo, we may collect financial information, including credit card number, bank routing numbers, tax information, taxpayer identification number, and other payment information, as applicable. We use Financial Information in order to operate the Brikmo Platform and to ensure that Helpers are paid by Customers. We do this as necessary for our legitimate interests in providing our platform and services and to fulfill our contracts with Users. To keep your financial data secure, we have contracted with a secure third party to maintain and process your payment card information.




      Promotional Information. Certain offerings of the Brikmo Platform, such as newsletters, surveys, contests, and the like are optional and so you are not required to enter them or to give us your data in connection with them. Where you do consent to take advantage of Brikmo Platform offerings, we will use your data to (as applicable) send you newsletters and other communications that are tailored based on information we have about you, or to operate and manage the survey, contest or similar offering in connection with our legitimate interest in promoting our business and the Brikmo Platform. To opt-out of receiving marketing communications from us, please see the Choice/Opt-Out section below.




      Content Information. You also may choose to send Brikmo Personal Information in an email or chat message containing inquiries about the Brikmo Platform and we use this Information in order to help us respond to your inquiry. We also collect content within any messages you exchange with other Users through the Service (such as through our chat functionality), and we will never use or share such information for marketing purposes.




      Location Data, including imprecise location data (such as location derived from an IP address or data that indicates a city or postal code level), and, with your consent, precise location data (such as latitude/longitude data). When you visit the Brikmo Platform via a native mobile application, we use, with your consent when required under applicable law, GPS technology (or other similar technology) to determine your current location in order to determine the city you are located in and display a relevant location map. We will not share your current location obtained in this manner with other Users.




      Cookies. When you visit Brikmo websites or Sites, your browser may automatically transmit information to these websites throughout the visit. In a similar way, when you use our mobile applications, we will access and use mobile device IDs to recognize your device. We use “cookies” and equivalent technologies to collect information through our Site and Apps. Cookies are small data files stored on your device that act as a unique tag to identify your browser.




      You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you will not be able to use all portions or all functionalities of the Brikmo Platform.




      To change your cookie settings for cookies on the Sites, please click on the following addresses based on the browser you use: Internet Explorer/Microsoft Edge, Safari, Chrome, Firefox, and Opera.




      Pixels. We and our Third Party Agents may also use "pixel tags," "web beacons," "clear GIFs," or similar means in connection with the Brikmo Platform and HTML-formatted email messages to, among other things, track the actions of Users and email recipients, determine the success of marketing campaigns, and compile statistics about Site usage and response rates.




      We only retain collected information for as long as necessary to provide you with your requested service. What data we store, we’ll protect within commercially acceptable means to prevent loss and theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use or modification.




      We don’t share any personally identifying information publicly or with third-parties, except when required to by law. We may receive additional information about you, such as demographic data, Financial Information, or fraud detection information, from Third Party Agents and combine it with other information that we have about you, to the extent permitted by law, in order to comply with our legal obligations and for the legitimate interest in improving the Brikmo Platform. Brikmo may work with Third Party Agents to perform identity checks, criminal background checks, and right to work checks on Helpers, if applicable and permitted by local law, in order to advance our legitimate interests in ensuring the safety of our Users and maintaining the integrity of the Brikmo Platform.




      Our app may link to external sites that are not operated by us. Please be aware that we have no control over the content and practices of these sites, and cannot accept responsibility or liability for their respective privacy policies.




      3. Legal Obligations




      Brikmo and our Third Party Agents may disclose information or User Generated Content, including location data or communication data, to a third party if required or permitted to do so by law or pursuant to a court order, warrant or subpoena. Brikmo reserves the right to disclose Personal Information from both private and public areas of the Site(s) and the Brikmo Platform in the absence of a court order, warrant or subpoena, to the extent permitted by applicable law, if we are given reason to believe, in our sole discretion, that someone is performing illegal acts on the Brikmo Platform, causing injury to, or interfering with the rights of Users, the general public, or Brikmo or its partners, parents or affiliates.




      It is our policy to provide notice to Users before producing their information in response to law enforcement requests unless (i) we are prohibited or otherwise constrained by law or court order from doing so, (ii) we have reason to believe the User’s account has been compromised such that the notice would go to the wrong person, or notice would otherwise be counterproductive or would create a risk to safety, or (iii) it is an emergency request and prior notice would be impractical (in which case we may provide notice after the fact).




      4. Your Rights and Choices




      You may opt-out of receiving promotional communications from us and our Partners, remove your information from our database, choose to not receive future promotional communications related to the Brikmo Platform, or cancel your account by logging on to the Site(s) and clicking on the “Account Settings” button, or by contacting us.


      Push Notifications. You have the option to receive updates and relevant offers via push notifications in your app. These notifications can be configured in the settings of your mobile device.




      Corrections to Profile. You have the right to access, update, and correct inaccuracies in your Brikmo Profile at any time by logging in and clicking on the “Account” tab. There, you can view, update, and correct your Account information. Our databases automatically update any information you edit in your Profile under the “Account Settings” button.




      So that we may protect the integrity of the Brikmo Platform, there are certain pieces of information, such as your age, that you cannot alter yourself. For example, since children under the age of majority in their jurisdiction of residence are not allowed to register as Users, we need to take reasonable measures to preserve the accuracy of our Users' ages. The practice of State-issued identification card verification is the primary way the Brikmo Platform ensures the legitimacy of age.




      You are free to refuse our request for your personal information, with the understanding that we may be unable to provide you with some of your desired services.




      5. Brikmo’s Security of Collected Information




      Your Brikmo account is password-protected so that only you and authorized Brikmo staff have access to your account information. In order to maintain this protection, do not give your password to anyone. Also, if you share a computer, you should sign out of your Brikmo account and close the browser window before someone else logs on. This will help protect your information entered on public terminals from disclosure to third parties.




      6. Notification of Changes




      Brikmo's Privacy Policy is periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary. This Privacy Policy might change as Brikmo updates and expands the Brikmo Platform. Brikmo will endeavor to notify you of any material changes by email. Brikmo also encourages you to review this Privacy Policy periodically.




      7. Children’s Privacy




      This service is intended for a general audience, and is not directed at children under 13 years of age. In certain jurisdictions, this minimum age may be higher. Please check the Jurisdiction-specific Provisions below for more information.




      We do not knowingly gather personal information (as defined by the U.S. Children’s Privacy Protection Act, or “COPPA”) in a manner not permitted by COPPA. If you are a parent or guardian and you believe that we have collected information from your child in a manner not permitted by law, please let us know by contacting us here. We will remove the data.




      We do not knowingly collect or “sell” the Personal Information of minors under 18 years old who are California residents.




      8. Contacting Us
